# üì¶ Utils - Developer Productivity Command-Line Utilities

## üìù Description

This Ruby gem delivers a curated collection of command-line utilities designed
to streamline software development workflows and automate repetitive tasks. The
toolkit spans multiple domains including code analysis, testing automation,
file manipulation, and system administration.

### Key Features

- **Ruby-Centric Approach**: Built leveraging Ruby's expressive syntax,
  metaprogramming capabilities, and dynamic nature
- **Multi-Functional Tools**: From simple CLI interfaces to sophisticated
  automation workflows
- **Modern Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with popular development
  frameworks, external services (including LLMs via Ollama), and system tools
- **Modular Architecture**: Lightweight design allowing selective tool usage
  without heavy dependencies
- **Composability**: Tools designed to work together or independently

### Technical Approach

The utilities embrace Ruby's strengths through:
- Dynamic method dispatch and metaprogramming techniques
- Expressive DSLs for configuration and tool definition
- Seamless integration with Git, vim, SSH, and terminal multiplexers
- Performance-conscious design with pattern matching for pruning operations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The `~/.utilsrc` configuration file uses Ruby syntax to define settings for
various utility components. This file allows you to customize the behavior of
different utilities without modifying their source code.

Each configuration block corresponds to a specific utility or category of
utilities. The settings within each block control how those utilities behave
during execution. The configuration system supports:

- **Pattern matching**: Regular expressions for including/excluding files and
  directories
- **Performance optimization**: Caching mechanisms and pruning rules to avoid
  unnecessary processing
- **Integration capabilities**: Settings for connecting with external tools
  like SSH, vim, and terminal multiplexers
- **Environment customization**: Ability to set environment variables and
  default paths

The configuration is loaded at runtime and can be modified without requiring a
restart of the utilities. Changes take effect immediately for subsequent
operations.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: Since this is Ruby syntax, you have access to full Ruby
capabilities within the configuration blocks. You can use variables, methods,
conditional logic, and other Ruby features to create dynamic configurations
when needed.

```ruby
# vim: set ft=ruby:

# ~/.utilsrc - Utility configuration file
# This file contains configuration settings for various utility components

## Search Configuration
