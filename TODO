- option for search to display all files that would be searched
- make -I option take a list (comma <- or spaces seperated?)

CHECK
- When finding many places in the same file only jump to the first occurence if
  a cli option is given.
- Make it configurable to find the same file many times via different symlinks
  or to find it only once.
- Stop finder from going in infinite symlink circles
