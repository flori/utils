- improve backup mechanism for new configuration, interactivity?

CHECK
- When finding many places in the same file only jump to the first occurence if
  a cli option is given.
- Make it configurable to find the same file many times via different symlinks
  or to find it only once.
- Stop finder from going in infinite symlink circles
